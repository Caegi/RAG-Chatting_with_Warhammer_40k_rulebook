I imported the Llama 3.2 model and tried some templatting and chat with the model. 

Secondly, I experimented with [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/gettingstarted) and built a first RAG.

Thirdly, I used the section headers and BM25 to try and improve the retriever.

Finally, I allowed conversations with documents by keeping track of the conversation history.
